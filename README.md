This is my entertainment bot for Discord Hack Week, hope you like it!

The OOTDgenerator was made to help you find the perfect outfit based on your inputs. It can also help you find accessories or shoes to match your OOTD. This bot can be used for either super important fashion emergencies, or just to look at cute outfits for fun! 

Bot prefix = 'ootd'
Commands:
outfit: When this command is called the bot will ask you questions to help find your perfect outfit. The first question is what gender you want the outfit to fit, then what season you want the outfit to fit, then what style you want your outfit to be. After you have answered these questions the bot will send a picture of your perfect OOTD.


accesorry: When this command is called the bot will ask you a couple questions to help you find what you are looking for. It will first ask you what item you are looking for. Then it will ask what style of that item you want. It will then bring up a slideshow of items that go along with your inputs. There will be a back arrow, stop sign, and forward arrow underneath the first picture. If you react with the forward arrow it will go to the next picture, and back to the previous picture if you react with the back arrow. If you react with the stop sign it will close the slideshow.

shoes: When this command is called the bot will ask you what style of shoe you would like then, like the 'accessory' command, will bring up a slideshow of shoes that fit that style.

all: When this command is called the bot will give you a choice of either looking at a list of all the clothing images, or a slideshow of them. If you choose the list option then the bot will send a long, numbered list of images which are all named by the gender-season-style they fit into. You can then type the number of what outfit you would like to see and the bot will send that image. If you choose slideshow then the bot will show a slideshow similar to the ones in the accessory and shoes command of all the outfits.

help: When this is called the bot will send the command prefix, list of commands, and any notes.

Command Notes: You can use - between 'ootd' and the command for all the commands ex: ootdoutfit or ootd-outfit. The commands are case sensitive so OOTDOUTFIT != ootdoutfit, the command calls must be all lowercase.

Other Notes: I am already running this bot so it should be on 24/7. But if you want to host it yourself then you can just copy the code and paste it into an IDE.
